            Ink Hunter is an app that uses AR technology to allow customers to
            use their smartphone to preview what a tattoo design would look like
            on their skin. To view a complete competetive analysis, click

            When designing an experience, it's imperative to think about
            context. That's why I created user personas based on real-world
            data. These are imaginary people with traits and attitudes from real
            people. And not just any people! I researched tattoo artists, tattoo
            enthusiasts, and casuals. I was now able to create personas that
            InkTank would be designed for. You will meet Janice, who is going to
            be the example for this case study. When I got stuck or was
            second-guessing myself, I asked, "What would Janice want? What would
            she think about this"?
          </p>

          <h2>The Big Problem</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            With personas in mind, I refined the problem list and extracted a
            few of the most important ones. This allowed me to build a problem
            statement.<br />
            Making a problem statement helps clearly define what I'm up against.
            Now I can outline my solution and get started on a prototype.<br />
            Janice needs a pain free way to find a tattoo artist that will make
            her a piece she will always love because she doesn't know a lot
            about tattoo styles and feels overwhelmed. We will know this to be
            true when Janice uses our app to find both what styles she likes and
            an artist who can create a beautiful tattoo she will love
            forever.<br />
            The best solution will be an app where Janice can select picture
            examples of styles she likes and doesn't like. Then she'll be able
            to browse local artists in that style, check on reviews and chat
            with them to see if they're a good fit.

              I created a sitemap to help me understand how users would navigate

              Janice's user persona and task flow help guide the design process
              and prioritize features as well. Designing with someone in mind is
              crucial to success and efficiency during the process. The first
              version of the home page had a suggested artist for the user upon
              opening the app. For a few reasons, I redesigned this completely
              in later iterations.

            <p>
              I redesigned the home page to feature a feed of tattoo content
              from other users. I wanted users to have the power to sort by
              people and artists they follow, by local artists and posts, or
              suggested content. I initially was using a red, white, and grey
              scheme for simplicity and visibility.

            Now that I had a solid working prototype, I wanted to begin testing
            my ideas and refining the design.<br />
            I recruited five participants, giving them tasks and scenarios. I
            like giving out scenarios to help put InkTank into a real-world
            context, and it can help participants understand how the app is
            ideally supposed to be used.

          <h3>Usability Tests</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Create an account</li>
            <li>Search for balck and white tattoo artists</li>
            <li>Submit a new tattoo idea.</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            I ran five tests, with a mix of in-person and remote testing. I
            recorded the screen and computer audio, and in remote sessions, I
            used zoom screen share to view the participant's screen. Due to the
            COVID-19 19 pandemic, I only conducted in-person tests with people
            in my quarantine bubble.<br />
            In total, I uncovered five specific errors thanks to the test
            sessions. These pain points ranged from medium to high severity, so
            fixing them was critically important for InkTank's success. Perhaps
            the most important error was the instance where one participant
            could not submit the tattoo idea. This was catastrophic because if
            users can't submit their ideas to local artists, InkTank doesn't
            offer artists something they're missing; Marketing, networking, and
            booking all in one platform.

              Over 70% of participants preferred the darker splash screen.
              According to UsabilityHub, the difference is likely to be 95%
              statistically significant.<br />Using the significant results and
              the user feedback, I quickly updated our high-fidelity wireframes.
              The lighter background color is easier on the eyes, and the signup
              form now has a lighter background color. I applied this to each
              screen.
