                                I have always gravitated towards digital design and technology. Years ago, a colleague who is a software developer recommended looking to UX design and seeing how that worked for me. I created a design for a
                                web store and had a crudely designed mess of a prototype ready for him the next day. I was hooked but I couldnʼt afford a Bootcamp at that time. I was just beginning my sales position after working my way up
                                from the warehouse and had student debt and rent to pay. After working as a painter in New York City I could afford it, and due to the Covid 19 pandemic, I had about 2 months with no work and lots of time to
                                develop my UX skills and knowledge. As a student who is passionate about UX design, I am extremely excited to continue and finish my CareerFoundry Bootcamp. I plan on continuing my education with more design
                                Bootcamps and courses, because people are complex, and in order to help them accomplish their goals, I want to know all I can.
